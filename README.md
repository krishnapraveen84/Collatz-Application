## Collatz Conjecture
> The Collatz Conjecture is a mathematical conjecture concerning a sequence derived from a given positive
   integer.  
 >The sequence follows specific rules, eventually reaching the number 1. The rules are as follows:
    > If the current term is even, the next term is one half of the current term.
    >If the current term is odd, the next term is 3 times the current term plus 1.

## React Class Components from React library
    > import { Component } from 'react';
    > Used state to store the user entered number and sequence of numbers
    > Used event handler i.e onChange to update the user input (handleSubmit)
   
## calculateCollatzSequence Function 
    > It generates the sequence of Numbers and update the state with new sequence (calculateCollatzSequence)

## Graphical Representation Using React Third party package Recharts
    > Used line grap to represents the sequence of numbers
